# Vcon4

You need a Python environment with at least Python.Version <=3.11.2.
In the file requirements.txt are all the needed dependencies. To run the program you need to have a webcam otherwise, the program will not be able to show the game.

For running, simply execute the main.py file. The game is controllable with all gestures, as soon as you do a gesture, it will detect it. It concentrates on the tip of the index finger, so whatever gesture you are making, the tip of the index finger has to hover over the menu item you want to choose or the column you want to drop the token in. I would suggest trying with the open-palm gesture :)

After winning, a winning screen is displayed which you can close by making the victory gesture (a "V" with the index and middle finger).

We could not figure out, why the victory screen is so laggy though :(
